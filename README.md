Hi, Welcome to my weather app, `Weather2Day`.

# Overview
    Weather2Day is an app that gives the current weather condition of the user entered city. It provides the user with a detailed information of the temperature, humidity, wind, precipitatio, uvIndex and the time of the sunrise and sunset as well.
    This project is build using React JS, to make a concise app with reusable components, faster rendering and smooth user experience. The city based weather information is fetched using an open-source API of Visual Crossing Weather. 
    
# The app is hosted at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app .

# Steps to use Weather2Day
    1. New user need to register into the app on the url, /signUp.
    2. Post successful signUp, user will get a toast of mail sent to registered email id and redirected to /login page
    3. Once signed up, user can login using the registered email.
    4. On succeesful login, user will land to /homepage where user can enquire today's weather
    5. To get the current weather update, user needs to enter the city value and click on the "Weather Today" button
    6. User can view his/her profile clicking on "My Profile" under the avatar icon in navbar and update the user details.
    7. To logout of the app, click on "Logout" under the same avatar icon in navbar.

It was extensive fun building `Weather2Day`, I hope you can plan your day as per the weather reports, so as to `not get wet by the rain, scorched by the sun or blown away by the storm`. Enjoy!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
